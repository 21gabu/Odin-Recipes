<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <p> <li><strong>Butter:</strong>This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Vanilla:</strong>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Baking Soda:</strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li></p>
                <p><li><strong>Water:</strong>A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li></p>
                    <p><li><strong>salt:</strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty</li></p>
                        <p><li><strong>Flour:</strong>All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li></p>
                            <p><li> <strong>Chocolate Chips:</strong>Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li></p>
   <p> <li><strong>Nuts (optional):</strong>Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</li></p>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <p><li>Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li></p>
    <p><li>Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to mixture.</li></p>
    <p><li>Stir in the flour, chocolate chips and walnuts.</li></p>
    <p><li>Drop dough onto a prepared baking sheet.</li></p>

<h2>How Long to Bake Chocolate Chip Cookies </h2>
<p>In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, the chocolate chip cookies should be perfectly baked in about 10 minutes. The edges should be golden brown and the cookies should be mostly set (they'll continue to set as the cool). </p>
