<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <p> <li><strong>Butter:</strong>This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li></p>
    <p><li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong>Vanilla:</strong>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Baking Soda:</strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li></p>
                <p><li><strong>Water:</strong>A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li></p>
                    <p><li><strong>salt:</strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty</li></p>
                        <p><li><strong>Flour:</strong>All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li></p>
                            <p><li> <strong>Chocolate Chips:</strong>Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li></p>
   <p> <li><strong>Nuts (optional):</strong>Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</li></p>
